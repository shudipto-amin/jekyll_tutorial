The flight is a few days away.
Had a lot to do, but somehow feeling rather fatigued today. 
I just wanna close my eyes, and ...

... I'm on the plane.
What just happened? 
I could've sworn I was sitting at my desk.
Must've dozed off and dreamt I was back in Calgary.

I'm in Berlin - no, Hamburg!
Standing in front of a poster, half a dozen eyes on me.
The closest one asking me, "Are you okay?"
"Err, yes", I blinked.

Everybody's running, screaming. 
Sirens blaring, and I am standing confused.
I get it now! Everytime I blink, I skip ahead in time!
A shell lands within ten meters, I feel a sledgehammer made of air pound against my chest, and shards slicing my eyes.

I stare at something bright, but shapeless. 
A voice asks me, "Do you see anything?"
I reply, "yes! but I don't know what it is."
"That's alright, it'll take time for you to regain your full vision."

> Then after one particular blink, I wake up somewhere else in time entirely.
> After my death.
>  After the heat death of the universe, when time has no more direction.
> I wake up randomly at random times of existence with each blink. 
> I see everything yet understand nothing._

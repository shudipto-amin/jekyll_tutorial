# This is just my attempt to try out [Github Pages with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll)

I used [this tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) to build the site, 
and  followgin [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) to configure Jekyll for Github Pages.
